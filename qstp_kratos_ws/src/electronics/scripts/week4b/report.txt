Week3:
I had the opportunity to look through what different teams who have participated in URC have done. It was amazing to see their complex ways to come out with rovers.

I have also learnt writing publishers and subscribers, creating a custom ros message.

Week4:
I learnt about the kinematics of differential drive robots and also was able to understand principles of the PID controller. It was a good experience to implement the PID controller on the turtlebot in gazebo simulator.
I also learnt about the tf library in ros. I also learn about forward and inverse kinematics for tackling coordinates in different coordinate frames.
