Week 4b:
========

For the first question the code is in the solutions.py
There are also two different coordinate frames namely camera_rot and object_rot. These are made because tf library first translates and then makes the rotation. So I have made the rotation and the translation part separately. 

For the second question, along with the rosrun command please give the x and y coordinates as parameters to the end_effector.py
